- Maybe walk through some of the 175 course together.
- 'In-order delivery' seems like a waste of time, no? That's what the SYN flag is for?
- Talk about part-time work.
- Go through LS170 PDU model to iron out vagueness.
- discuss: ' The ethernet protocol allows for communication between two devices on a network. The internet protocol allows for communicationbetween two devices any where in the world.'
