## [About this course](https://launchschool.com/lessons/15115b5d/assignments/f2a825e3)

- Working with the HTTP request/response cycle, building a program in Ruby.
- Working with Sinatra. 
- Deploying an app to the web.
- Security considerations. 
- Using a structured software development work-flow.

### Backend assessment

- RB189 is an assessment for both RB175 and RB185. There is a project and an interview.

### What to focus on

- HTTP
- What's going on under the hood in Sinatra.
- The HTTP request/response cycle and URL parsing.
- Stay high-level. So don't focus on Sinatra specifically, but rather consider what a web development framework does.
  - What is a route?
  - What is a template?
- Get comfortable with the development process. At the end of the course we build up a web-app using this process. We will also add tests.

### Code reviews

- Not possible.
